# Multi-Class-Sentiment-Analysis-using-CNN

The main goal is to develop a robust and scalable convolutional neural network to overcome the problems faced in Sentiment Analysis for text-based movie reviews. Bag of Words and TF-IDF are the two feature extraction methods considered in this experiment. Both the methods have been compared and have been plotted for visual representation. Accuracy, Loss, Precision, F1 Score and Recall are the comparative measures. Multiple models were constructed, and the results have been discussed in this paper. Though convolutional neural networks are not the absolute solution, but it has shed light on some interesting aspects. Rotten Tomatoes dataset has been used for training and testing. Dataset contains the phrase and sentiment of the review. The results and observation have been tabulated. The paper has been concluded with comparison between BoW and TF-IDF and after evaluating the results, TF-IDF has better accuracy than BoW.
